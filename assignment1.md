# Simulated Augmented Reality Windshield Display
(as a Cognitive Mapping Aid for Elder Driver Navigation)

- A common effect of aging is decline in spatial cognition.
- Evaluation shows that it results in a significant reduction in navigation
errors and distraction-related measures.

- older adults have more difficulty in cognitive mapping, the ability
to accurately represent a spatial environment mentally

- USing a system creates issues with divided attention in having to focus on
both the information display and the road, and extra cognitive load in matching
the computer-generated streets on the GPS system to the real streets in the
3-dimensional perspective that drivers have

- Existing GPS systems are not helpful for elder drivers.

Problem focuses;
- Cognative distance
- Divided attention

With the quantitive and Qualitative results the paper shows that for elderly
drivers the 2.5d-windshield approach is better.
