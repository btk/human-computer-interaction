"Most profound techs are those that disappear." - Mark Weiser, 1991

## User Interface Design Rules

- ISO 9241 standard rules.

**Shneiderman's 8 golden rules**
- Consistency
- Shortcuts
- Providing feedback
- Error prevention, reversal of action
- User should feel in control
- Reduce short term memory load

*Iterate until you arrive to the final result*
