# Evaluating User Interfaces

Role of evaluation; get user feedback and correct faults in the UI.

Evaluation
- Implementation
- Task analysis
- Prototyping
- Requirements specs
- Conceptual design

**If usability is not there, functionality is useless**

Usage Data;
- Observations
- Monitoring
- User's Opinions

*Evaluation should be considered in all stages of product development*

## Reasons for doing evaluations
- Understanding the real world
- Comparing designs
- Engineering towards a target
- Checking conformance to a standard

* Can't wait till the end of development to start evaluation. Involve focus users
as early as possible.

## Evaluation Methods
- Interpretive evaluation: real users involved
- Predictive evaluation: predictive problems users will encounter without testing with users. (*Avoid*) Requires objectivity (Not the developer)

**Pilot study for all types!! -- smaill study before main study to work out problems with experiment itself**

### Think Aloud:*
- Why did you click that button?
- What did you think will happen next?

### Questionnaires and surveys
- closed questions (agree, strongly agree, disagree / Likert Scale)
- open questions (text based answers)
- Be careful on being not ambigious, use a clear language
- Avoid hard recall questions.
