## Important Concepts

- Affordances:
  Chair is for sitting, pair of scisors' holes are for putting your finger in.
  Shapes can tell us what to do with an object (circler thing for turning)

- Visibility:
  Functionality is not being hidden to user, and apperent.
  Bathroom faucets, hot/cold, pressure
  Start button being lost in a lot of buttons.

- Conceptual models
  People have mental models of how things work
  Valve model

- Mapping
  Natural relationship between two things.
  Stove burner.

- Feedback
  Returned information of users actions.

- Transfer effect
  Wheel of a car -> wheel of all cars (y)
  Tennis -> Table tenis (x)

- Visual Constraints (USB vs HDMI)

## Why design is hard?

- The number of things to control has increased
- Marketplace pressure, getting to market fast needs to cut dev time on better design.
