# Prototyping Techniques

Prototype:
- low fidelity: low detail fast to build
- high fidelity: very close to real product

We compromise during creating a prototype (in some area; size, color, material etc.)

For project,
- UI prototype is a good deliverable.
- Evaluating it with users is important

### Why prototype

- Evaluation and feedback central to interaction design
- Users can see hold interact
- team member can communicate effectively
- prototype is a tool, helps us answer questions

## Low fidelity types
- Sketches
- Storyboards (xd style, used in cinema a lot)
- Pictive (Sticky notes, overlays)

## Medium fidelity prototypes

- Tutorials and manuals,
- Not much interactable like low fidelity, but a lot more dtails, interactions are
usually supplied with natural language, tutorials and manuals

*Incremental Approach* Design test and Add new features
*Evolutionary Approach* Design and evaluation happens in place of the previous

### Wizard of OZ Approach
Involve humans in the prototyping technique.
- Recognize hard to implement interactions using a human.

## High fidelity prototypes
- some parts are still not complete but very close
- *Danger:* user thinks its the final product
