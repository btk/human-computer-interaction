## Usability measures

- Rate of errors by users
- Retention over Time (frequency of use and ease of learning)
- Subjective satisfaction (does user like it?)

Information stored in memory;
* sensory
* short-term

**Each person is different**

## Vision
- physical reception of sitimulus

*Users' attention will be in a part of the interface always.*
Don't assume user will look at every part of the page.

## Error Types;
